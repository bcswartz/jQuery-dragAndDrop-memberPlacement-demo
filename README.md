# jQuery-dragAndDrop-memberPlacement-demo

This is the codebase for a demo of how you can use a drag-and-drop interface (in this case, powered by jQuery and jQueryUI) to create a
rich tool for placing individuals into certain groups based on different criteria exposed in the UI.

This demo was originally created back in March 2009 and hosted on a personal web server with a database that provided
the data.  It was ported here to GitHub to preserve it as inspiration for other developers, and the data for the demo
is now provided via Jekyll data files.

The working demo is available here: https://bcswartz.github.io/jQuery-dragAndDrop-memberPlacement-demo/
